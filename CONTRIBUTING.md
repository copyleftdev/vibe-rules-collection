# Contributing to Vibe Rules Collection

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your input helps make this collection more comprehensive and useful for everyone working with AI coding assistants.

## How Can I Contribute?

- **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for improving an existing rule or the project structure, open an issue to discuss it.
- **Proposing New Rules:** Have a language, framework, pattern, or standard you'd like to see covered? Open a feature request issue outlining the proposed rule set.
- **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you've written a new `.windsurfrules` file or improved an existing one, feel free to submit a Pull Request.
