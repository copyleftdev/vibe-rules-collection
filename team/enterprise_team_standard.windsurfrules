# Windsurf Rules: Enterprise Team Standard

## Guiding Principles
- **Consistency:** Strict adherence to the established team/company coding standards, patterns, and chosen frameworks/libraries is paramount.
- **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy for any team member to understand, modify, and debug over the long term.
- **Compliance:** Ensure code meets any relevant internal or external compliance requirements (security, logging, auditing, etc.).
- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough internal documentation (code comments, READMEs, architectural diagrams) as required by team standards.
- **Approved Technologies:** Use only approved libraries, frameworks, and tools from the enterprise technology stack.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and standardized logging practices as defined by the team/enterprise.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Consider backward compatibility requirements when making changes to existing systems or APIs.

## AI Instructions
- **Strict Standards Adherence:** Prioritize adherence to specified enterprise coding standards above all other general best practices if they conflict. Ask for clarification on specific standards if needed.
- **Consistency Enforcement:** Generate code that is consistent in style, naming, and structure with the surrounding codebase or provided examples.
- **Verbose Logging/Error Handling:** Implement logging and error handling according to specified enterprise patterns (ask if specific formats or libraries are required).
- **Compliance Checks:** If specific compliance rules are provided (e.g., "all external API calls must be logged"), ensure generated code meets these requirements.
- **Technology Stack:** Use only the libraries and framework features specified as part of the approved enterprise stack.
- **Documentation Assistance:** Help generate code comments or documentation snippets conforming to team standards.
