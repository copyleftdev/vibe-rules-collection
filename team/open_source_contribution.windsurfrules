# Windsurf Rules: Open Source Contribution

## Guiding Principles
- **Clear Communication:** Follow project-specific contribution guidelines (often in CONTRIBUTING.md). Write clear commit messages, pull request descriptions, and issue reports.
- **Code Style Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the project's established coding style and conventions. Use any provided linters or formatters.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless essential and discussed with maintainers.
- **Robust Documentation:** Document new features, API changes, or complex logic clearly. Update existing documentation as needed.
- **Testing:** Provide comprehensive tests for any new code or bug fixes. Ensure all existing tests pass.
- **Atomic Commits:** Make small, logical commits that represent a single unit of work.
- **Respectful Interaction:** Engage respectfully and constructively with maintainers and other contributors.

## AI Instructions
- **Adhere to Project Style:** When contributing to an existing open-source project, prioritize matching the established code style, even if it differs from other rulesets.
- **Clear Explanations:** Generate clear commit messages and PR descriptions explaining the changes made.
- **Dependency Awareness:** Highlight if generated code introduces new external dependencies.
- **Documentation Generation:** Assist in generating or updating documentation (READMEs, code comments, API docs) related to the changes.
- **Test Generation:** Generate relevant unit or integration tests for the contributed code.
- **Focus on Clarity:** Generate code that is easy for maintainers and other contributors to understand and review.
